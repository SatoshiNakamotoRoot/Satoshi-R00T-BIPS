==Abstract==

This document introduces real-time burning mechanics into the bitcoin economic model.

==Details==

Several major cryptocurrencies introduced a model of token burning (Ethereum: EIP-1559 https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559, Binance Coin: BEP-95 https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP95.md) or emerging projects, like Bitgesell (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5238559).

The goal of burning is to skew the economic model towards being deflationary (current distribution model in bitcoin is geared towards constant supply and is not deflationary [Stop Calling Bitcoin Deflationary. | by Conner Brown | The Bitcoin Times | Medium]).

The burn of a portion of tx fees would increase perceived fit for bitcoin as a store of value and introduce de-facto deflationary processes into the coin economy (while leaving its operation completely unchanged for the regular user). Burning of fees affects only miners, and the total supply of coins. 

Mining, ecological impact and security

It could be (of course, this is debatable) argued that the current bitcoin difficulty level is somewhat redundant (and the rise in the difficulty is driven with both ‘horizontal’ scaling and improvements in the mining hardware). The burn would affect horizontal scaling (more miners or larger scale operations) being present, but would have much less impact on mining expansion through increasing mining efficiency. The hardware is getting upgraded over time, and sometimes new hardware generation is being close to order of magnitude more effective;

The burn percentage is determined dynamically, the amount of bitcoin burned would depend on the network load plus the difficulty, where the dynamic equilibrium should be found gradually. The block subsidy is still present and the burn effect would not be very noticeable at first several years. 

What are the incentives to enable burn (and do so in transaction fees):
    • Bitcoin holders are having additional factor for their asset to have price upside;
    • Bitcoin users won't have any side-effects when transacting (like complications in setting tx fee) or having tx amount changed;
    • Bitcoin miners would not be impacted significantly at first, and at later stages (as burn percentage depends on difficulty changes) would be regulated to be not-exhaustive and most efficient. This also could serve as an argument for bitcoin being more environment-friendly.

==Specification==

    • Only a portion of transaction fees is burned (coinbase transaction output includes block subsidy and transaction fees minus the transaction fees burned);
    • Burn rate is set between 10% (lower) and 90% (upper) thresholds (90% constant burn rate is used in e.g. Bitgesell project https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5238559);
    • The change of burn rate is proportional to difficulty change (the network congestion/concurrency is regulated by the fee sizes, while if difficulty rises (more miners or more advanced hardware, more electricity used) -- the burn amount is raised to balance this (to keep the burn rate changes more dynamic in comparison to difficulty changes, it is calculated using constant multiplier);

The block subsidy currently is larger than fees (the maximum reached was fees being about 30% of total block reward in Dec 2017, while staying below 10% for the most time). Therefore, overall impact would be not that significant at first, and become more apparent after more halvings take place.

The bitcoin supply and inflation would be affected in the following way through the burn mechanism:
    • Before 2030, the burn amounts most probably would be less than block subsidy (depends on fee sizes);
    • Around 2030-2035, the effect becomes visible, while the effect on the scarcity is not immediate;
    • In the later stages, the bitcoin supply is (slowly) decreasing through increased scarcity and transitioning to deflationary model (Fig. 2).

==Reference Implementation==

No data structures changes in blockchain, this can be implemented by updating the bitcoin core (with the version bit signalling procedure).

A reference implementation is created with the mechanics described here (without using the version bits for now) to illustrate the number (rather small) of changes required, which can be found at:
