==Abstract==

This BIP describes the consensus rules on disclosing yourself or a fellow person as a possible candidate for the position of "Satoshi Nakamoto"

==Specification==

As part of the specification, to coincide with the every other halfing, tributes to the position of "Satoshi Nakamoto" should be discussed and consensus should be achieved on the new "Satoshi Nakamato". The consensus rules should require a 1% majority of major media outlets including print and online media for nomination. The person disclosed shall be scrutinized by the community to the maximum of their ability in order to debunk the "Satoshi Nakamoto" candidate as swiftly as possible.

Candidates should be outlined utilizing a standardized matrix and classified by "Satoshi Class"

! Satoshi Class !! Examples !! Description
|-
| Satoshi Class A || Dorian Nakamoto || Non-technology person with no bitcoin background
|-
| Satoshi Class B  || No Example Exists || Technology person with no bitcoin background
|-
| Satoshi Class C || Craig Wright || Technology person with some bitcoin background
|}

==Motivation==

As a community, we must band together to ensure that there is between zero and one "Satoshi Nakamoto" active at any time. As such, the quicker we debunk "Satoshi Nakamoto" candidates, the quicker we can continue on our journey to discover the real "Slim Shady"

==Rationale==

By having clear rules of succession for candidates, we can ensure a steady flow of "Satoshi Nakamoto" for the entire duration of the coinbase reward estimated to take place around 2140. We also allow any existing bitcoin software to certify immediately that they implement BIP-146.
