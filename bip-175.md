# TAIL emmission

Tail emmission is the process of creating coin after the supply had been exhausted.

Bitcoin need tail emmission to maintain the security of the blockchain and to prevent bitcoin from becomming a bubble.

Rather than halfing the block reward after 6.25 bitcoins, bitcoin should instead use a fixed block reward of 5 bitcoins.

Tail emmission may cause bitcoin price to go down a bit but this is compensated by increased chain security.

If miners are not paid block rewards after 21 million coins, they will quit mining and the security of the chain will be lost.

In the worst case scenario, bitcoin may cease to exist if all the miners quit mining.
