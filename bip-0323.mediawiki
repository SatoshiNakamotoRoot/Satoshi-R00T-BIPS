==Abstract==

Market depending block size:
| Satoshi per byte
| about allowed blocksize
| 0 satoshi/byte | 41kb
| 1 satoshi/byte | about 300kb
| 10 satoshi/byte | about 1Mb
| 100 satoshi/byte | about 2Mb
| 1k satoshi/byte | about 3Mb
| 10k satoshi/byte | about 4Mb
| 100k satoshi/byte | about 5Mb
| 1M satoshi/byte | about 6Mb
| 10M satoshi/byte | about 7Mb
| 1 bitcoin/byte | about 8Mb

==Motivation==

# Keep block space small, waste less with spam, allow larger size when sender pays a lot.
# Allow wallets to calculate/display how much average free block space there is for each fee price.
# Allows senders to be more sure about how the fee/priority of their transaction will behave, especially in the case of increased adoption in the future.

==Specification==

* Every transaction has to fit into the following block space:
  floor( log10( 1.1d + Fee in satoshi per byte of current transaction) * 1024 * 1024 bytes )
  

==Implementation==

# Sort transactions by "statoshi per byte fee" (lowest first)
# For each Transaction from lowest "statoshi per byte fee": Sum up the bytes of space used so far.
# For each Transaction: Check if "Sum up the bytes of space used so far" smaller or equal to formula result.
# If this is valid for each transaction then the blocksize is valid.

==Backward compatibility==

Hard fork required.
