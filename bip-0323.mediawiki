==Abstract==

Market depending block size:
If a sender is willing to pay a large fee, the transaction may be allowed in a block even if blocksize for lower fee transactions is full. Yet the blocksize is limited harshly by a formula.

==Motivation==

# Keep block space small, waste less with spam, allow larger size when sender pays a lot.
# Allow wallets to calculate/display how much average free block space there is for each fee price.
# Allows senders to be more sure about how the fee/priority of their transaction will behave, especially in the case of increased adoption in the future.

==Specification==

* Every transaction has to fit into the following block space:
  floor( log10( 1.1d + Fee in satoshi per byte of current transaction) * 1024 * 1024 bytes )
  

==Implementation==

# Sort transactions in a block by "statoshi per byte fee" (lowest first)
# For each Transaction from lowest "statoshi per byte fee": Sum up the bytes of space used so far.
# For each Transaction: Check if "Sum up the bytes of space used so far" is smaller or equal to formula result.
# If this is valid for each transaction then the blocksize is valid.

==Backward compatibility==

Hard fork required.
